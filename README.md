🌐 HTML and CSS_project

This project uses semantic HTML to structure the page into meaningful sections and accessible form elements, relying on native form validation instead of JavaScript.
CSS techniques include Flexbox for layout, full-height background images with overlays for readability, external fonts for branding, and consistent spacing and color hierarchy.
Interactive styling is achieved with pseudo-classes like :focus and :invalid to provide visual feedback, resulting in a clean, modern, desktop-first design.
